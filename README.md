# psobb-custom-HUD

this addon allows the user to build their own HUD, from within the game. it uses a lot of reworked code from other addons: Soly's Player Reader, Item Reader, and Monster Reader, Tornupgaming's XpBar, and Staphen's Kill Counter.

this addon is not even close to complete; but it has most of the core features i wanted, with the notable exception of hp bars for monsters and party members, and positioning windows by anchoring them to screen regions. here is a list of features i plan to add before i'm done:

* chat log
* window transparency
* option to hide custom HUD elements when menus or dialogs are open
* widget and window presets
* automatic HUD profile selection based on character name
* and a ton of little gui tweaks and special features to improve user-friendliness.
